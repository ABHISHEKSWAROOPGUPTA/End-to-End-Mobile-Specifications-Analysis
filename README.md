# End-to-End-Data-Mobile-Specifications-Analysis-Using-Sql-and-Power-Bi

Welcome to the Mobile Data Analysis project repository! This project utilizes SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization to analyze the mobile market trends for the year 2023. The project aims to provide insights into brand popularity, storage preferences, operating system distribution, 5G availability, battery capacity, and selfie camera specifications.

## Introduction
The Mobile Data Analysis project aimed to enhance decision-making by examining key aspects of the mobile market, such as brand popularity, internal storage preferences, operating system distribution, 5G availability, battery capacity, and selfie camera specifications. This end-to-end project integrated various data sources and utilized SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization to present meaningful insights.
## Situation
The objective was to create a data analysis dashboard to understand mobile market trends and derive insights to assist in strategic planning and marketing.
## Problem Statement
The Mobile Data Analysis project aimed to address several critical business questions:
1.	What are the most popular mobile brands?
2.	What is the distribution of internal storage capacities among available mobiles?
3.	How is the mobile market segmented by operating system?
4.	What is the availability of 5G technology in the mobile market?
5.	What are the common selfie camera specifications?
## Task
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize the mobile market data.

## Key Features:
1.	Analysis of the most popular mobile brands
2.	Distribution of internal storage capacities
3.	Market segmentation by operating system
4.	Insights into 5G technology availability
5.	Analysis of battery capacities
6.	Common selfie camera specifications
## Project Structure:
1.	SQL Scripts: Contains the SQL scripts used for data preprocessing.
2.	Power BI Dashboard: The .pbix file with the Power BI dashboard.
